To do extensive comparison of python and perl versions:

golden_test:
    unset ALL_LDBG
    gunzip -c ../examples-rtl/8.1.1port/fft.log.gz > tmp.fftlog
    golden_test.pl tmp.fftlog 8 1 2port > tmp.pl
    golden_test.py tmp.fftlog 8 1 2port > tmp.py
    diff -bB tmp.pl tmp.py

fft_golden_model
    export ALL_LDBG=1
    p=16; u=1;
    fft_golden_model.pl $p $u > tmp.pl
    fft_golden_model.py $p $u > tmp.py

    # Only diff should be that one says "PERL" and one says "PYTHON"
    diff tmp.pl tmp.py -I '^PERL$\|^PYTHON$'
    unset ALL_LDBG

DONE superceded by simv_analysis, see simv_analysis/README.md
# log=simv.log
# log=/nobackup/steveri/github/fftgen/examples/test8.vcs/simv.log
# c ; analyze_reads_and_writes.pl -d $log |\
# summarize_reads_and_writes.pl | egrep -v '^IGNORE|BB|wr' |\
#  uniq | sed 's/.*BREAK//' | less

DONE added gui/ to repo
add gui subdir to repo? -- tradeoffs:
- it doesn't really belong there
- don't need it there
- but it would be a place to keep it around
- fine so maybe make a trash directory or something

DONE - ADDED TO $fftgen/0notes-fft.txt
- may need to rethink test dir(s)


DONE - ADDED TO README
add_copyright.csh - add copyright info to a file
EXAMPLE: "add_copyright.csh rtl/mux.vp"

DONE moved to archives
# switch.csh - sets env variables that change the fft scheduling
# 4algorithm. I don't think it's used anymore.

DONE
  test0_clock.csh moved to archives; was "make gen TOP=clock; make run TOP=clock"
  test1_fftclock.csh moved to archives; was "make gen TOP=fftclock; make run TOP=fftclock"
  test_scheduler.pl moved to tst/bin and checked in
  test_swizzler.pl moved to tst/bin and checked in
  vlsiweb_hack.csh moved to gui/

DONE/KEPT
  add_copyright.csh - add copyright info to a file
  setup_genesis.csh
  simv_analysis/ - tools for analyzing simv log for correctness
  switch.csh NOPE DID NOT KEEP AFTER ALL, see below

DONE: LOSE / MOVE TO ARCHIVES
  analyze_reads_and_writes.pl
  count_collisions.pl
  gt8k.csh
  gt8kfoo.csh
  make_distribution.csh
  setup_genesis.sh.orig
  stanford_vcs_hack
  summarize_analysis.csh => summarize_analysis.sh
  switch.csh.old

DONE superceded by simv_analysis, see simv_analysis/README.md
  analyze_reads_and_writes.pl, summarize_analysis.csh (now summarize_analysis.sh)
  - tools to analyze reads and writes in simv.log;  doesn't seem to work very well
  - I think these are superceded by the contents of subdir simv_analysis


DONE moved to archives
  count_collisions.pl
  - not sure what this is/was, but it does not seem to work...

DONE moved to archives
  gt8k* - pretty sure these have been subsumed by golden_test.*

DONE moved to archives
  make_distribution.csh - github / "git clone" makes this unnecessary...right?



DONE checked in as gui/ subdirectory see gui/README
  TEST5.bash
  gui_extras.template
  gui_extras.template.0
  gui_hello.csh
  gui_test5.csh
  gui_test5.csh.0
  sorry.csh - apology message for test5 not working

DONE
- swizzle0* moved to doc/takala-table-compare, see README.md there.
- simv_analysis/ checked in
- switch.csh moved to archives
- gt8k* (symlinks) moved to archives

DONE
- combine bsr.awk, bsr_fix.awk into one
- make a wrapper I guess NOPE no need wrapper it's just too perfect as is :)

1906 bsr.awk is DONE
# For a good time try:
#   % bsr.awk help
